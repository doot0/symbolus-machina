# symbolus-machina
"Symbolus machina."

Essentially - a set of UI generators that consume a symbolic representation of a piece of UI (a UI token) from a federated shared repository and generates consumable, constantly and consistently updated resources based on it (e.g. Sketch files, CSS/SCSS styles, markup perhaps).
